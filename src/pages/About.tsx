            <h4>Testimonials</h4>
            <p><i>"Shirley and Joe helped us purchase our first home, and then helped us sell and move up into our beautiful home in Wailuku. More important Joe Blackburn was my fire engine driver when I got into the fire department and I fought fires side by side with him. Character and dedication to serve the public best describes Joe. He has now taken this same commitment to Real Estate where he is a great asset because of his knowledge and contacts in the community."</i></p>
            <p><i>"I work in a bank and trust Joe to do the right thing for my family. He will serve your needs well and put your wishes and desires before his own."</i></p>

          <div>
            <p><i>"Joe was my supervisor at Maui Electric and was the best boss I have had in 35 years of work in the utility industry. Due to our friendship, he helped me find a home in Kihei. I moved from Tucson to Maui and not only has Joe been my real estate agent but he has introduced me to the beauty and culture of the people of Maui. I truly understand why Maui is the best place in the world to live, its not just the weather it's the special people who are part of the fabric of the community and willing to share this with newcomers like myself."</i></p>
